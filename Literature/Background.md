## Background

In recent years, transformation of demographic and economic structure resulted in the unbalanced labor supply and demand in Taiwan. On the one hand, the birth rate has dropped from 2.297% in 1981 to 0.823% in 2017. The number of population increased by 327,947 people in 1981, but it only increased by 31,411 in 2017. On the other hand, the economic structure gradually changed from agriculture to production and service industries. The number of pople who worked in production and service industries increased from 2.3 million in 1971 to 8 millon in 2011. The population transition creates demand on labors, while the economic development requires more investment and educated, professional workers.

In October 1989, the Council of Labor Affairs (MOL) decided to open up Taiwan’s job market to migrant workers to respond to these issues. Foreign blue collar workers from Thailand, Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam, China and Mongolia are now 
allowed to work in Taiwan as part of solution of labor shortages. According to MOL, As of the end of December 2017, there were 676,142 foreign workers in Taiwan. Among them, 60.43% employed as manufacturing workers, 0.76% as construction workers, 1.82% on fishing crews, 36.71% as caretakers and 0.29% as domestic helpers. [Footnote](https://www.wda.gov.tw/cp.aspx?n=1C6028CA080A27B3) They can work as long as 12 years.  

Although migrant workers may attenuate the problem of labor supply as the birth rate is getting lower, brain drain becomes a serious problem for the economy that needs to be re-configured. In 2015, it is estimated that 724,000 people worked overseas, which is about 10% higher than 2009  [footnote]   (https://www.ndc.gov.tw/Content_List.aspx?n=E61E31EE6FB10140&upn=0A078649EEC83462). Stagnant salary is often cited as the major reason of emigration. Lin, Chang, and Lu (2017) analyzed data from 1980 to 2012 and pointed out that the the gross domestic product per capita (GDP) is negatively correlated with real wage in Taiwan; labors have limited share of economic growth. Despite that, Taiwan's government has aggresively attracted foreign talents. According to MOL, the number of foreign professionals increased from 11,228 in 2004 to 18,412 in 2017. The remarkable gap between the scale of immigration and emigration pushes the government to amend the Act for the Recruitment and Employment of Foreign Professionals, which is passed by the Legislative Yuan in 2017. The new law allows foreign professionals to extend their work permission from 3 years to five years. Foreigners can apply for temporary visa to find a job. Certainly, it remains to be seen whether more foreign professionals are coming to work in Taiwan.    

## Management
The abuse or mistreat of migrant workers is often made local headlines. They include lack of freedom to change employer, live-in situations with employers, and high broker fees in mother countries [(Jeremy Oliver, 2017)](https://sentinel.tw/improving-migrant-workers-taiwan/). In 2016, the government amended the Empolyment Serivce Act to improve the structures. After being hired, migrant workers do not have to leave the country every three years, which reduces the broker fees for re-entering the country. The employers also cannot refuse to give them paid leave as it is required by Labor Standards Act, a statue that mainly regulates domestic labor and employer. According to a survey conducted by MOL, the average salary of foreign manufacturing workers and caretakers have been increasing for the past three years. [(Ya-wen Li, 2018)](http://news.ltn.com.tw/news/life/breakingnews/2362896)     
Like other countries, Taiwanese are concerned that migrant workers replace vanishing Taiwanese workers. Lan (2010) found that employers of migrant workers tend to agree that migrant work forces can supplement local workers but employers of local workers tend to think that local workers are replaced by migrant labors.
