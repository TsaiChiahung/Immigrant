In recent years, transformation of demographic and economic structure resulted in the unbalanced labor supply and demand in Taiwan. On the one hand, the birth rate has dropped from 2.297% in 1981 to 0.823% in 2017. The number of population increased by 327,947 people in 1981, but it only increased by 31,411 in 2017.   

In response to these issues, the Council of Labor Affairs (MOL) decided to open up Taiwan’s job market to foreign workers 
starting in October 1989. Migrant workers from Thailand, Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam and Mongolia are now 
employed in Taiwan as part of the government’s efforts to solve the problems of labor shortages.  

As of the end of December 2017, there were 676,142 foreign workers in Taiwan, 60.43% employed as manufacturing workers, 
0.76% as construction workers, 1.82% on fishing crews, 36.71% as caretakers and 0.29% as domestic helpers.
