In recent years, transformation of demographic and economic structure resulted in the unbalanced labor supply and demand in Taiwan. On the one hand, the birth rate has dropped from 2.297% in 1981 to 0.823% in 2017. The number of population increased by 327,947 people in 1981, but it only increased by 31,411 in 2017. On the other hand, the economic structure gradually changed from agriculture to production and service industries. The number of pople who worked in production and service industries increased from 2.3 million in 1971 to 8 millon in 2011. The population transition creates demand on labors, while the economic development requires more investment and educated, professional workers.

In October 1989, the Council of Labor Affairs (MOL) decided to open up Taiwanâ€™s job market to foreign workers to respond to these issues. Migrant workers from Thailand, Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam, China and Mongolia are now 
allowed to work in Taiwan as part of solution of labor shortages. According to MOL, As of the end of December 2017, there were 676,142 foreign workers in Taiwan. Among them, 60.43% employed as manufacturing workers, 0.76% as construction workers, 1.82% on fishing crews, 36.71% as caretakers and 0.29% as domestic helpers.
