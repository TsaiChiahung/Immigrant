Cheng (2002)   
Tseng (2006) argued that Taiwan government intentionally classify "non-economic" immigrants from southeast Asia and China and "economic" immigrants from other countries. The "non-economic" immigrants who marry local Taiwanese are mostly in lower social class but the "economic" immigrants are better off.      
   

Chang and Chang (2013) found that in general Taiwanese prefer not to increase the number of immigrants. The well-off people are more accepting to immigrants and that indegenous Taiwanese are against more immigrants. Chang and Chang (2013) argued that people decide their attitudes based on ethnicity prejuice and economic conditions.      
Chen and Wu (2017) argued that gender, socio-economic status, ethnicity, and party support determine attitudes towards granting citizenship to immigrant spouses. People with Minnan heritage, pan-Green supporters and those living in rural area tend not to accommodate foreign migrants. Their research reveals the importance of economic condition and identity, but they did not consider the influence of culture and public policies.
