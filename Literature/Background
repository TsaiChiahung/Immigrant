In recent years, the unbalanced labor supply and demand in Taiwan has resulted in a lack of basic manpower. 
This can be attributed to a number of economic factors such as the transformation of industrial structure, rising per 
capita income, rapid growth in service industries, higher education levels, and a change in job values.   

In response to these issues, the Council of Labor Affairs (MOL) decided to open up Taiwan’s job market to foreign workers 
starting in October 1989. Migrant workers from Thailand, Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam and Mongolia are now 
employed in Taiwan as part of the government’s efforts to solve the problems of labor shortages.  

As of the end of December 2017, there were 676,142 foreign workers in Taiwan, 60.43% employed as manufacturing workers, 
0.76% as construction workers, 1.82% on fishing crews, 36.71% as caretakers and 0.29% as domestic helpers.
