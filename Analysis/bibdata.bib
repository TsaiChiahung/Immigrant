	maximize growth are optimal only for a government that cares solely
	about pure "capitalists." The greater the inequality of wealth and

	present empirical results that show that inequality in land and income

  abstract = {We compare patterns of electoral rule choice in two periods, that
	following the First World
	
	War in Western Europe and that following the end of the Cold War in
	Central and Eastern
	
	Europe. Heretofore, scholars have studied these two instances of electoral
	rule choice separately
	
	and have come to quite different conclusions about the implications
	of strategic behavior of the
	
	relevant actors. In the case of early 20th Century Western Europe,
	Rokkan and later Boix cast the
	
	choice of electoral rules as a result of coordinated strategic behavior
	by established parties in
	
	reaction to increasing support for new parties of the left. In contrast,
	recent analyses of the post-
	
	Cold War period in Central and Eastern Europe suggest that while all
	political actors acted
	
	strategically, an extreme lack of information prevented them from
	making choices that served
	
	their self-interest in the long run. Indeed, many party leaders supported
	electoral rules that later
	
	eliminated them from politics. We argue that uncertainty was a major
	factor in both periods of
	
	electoral rule design, so that political elites often made serious
	miscalculations of the effect of
	
	particular electoral rules on their own future success. A reanalysis
	of the Boix data suggests that
	
	efforts to explain the choice of electoral rules as a coordinated
	response by established parties to
	
	electoral threat must be viewed with skepticism, since uncertainty
	made success or failure almost
	
	impossible to predict. Instead, any strategic behavior was short-term
	at best, reflecting the largest
	
	party¡¦s most recent experience in the preceding election.},

	time series/cross-sectional panel analysis (n = 18, t = 2) reveals
	that consensual political
	
	institutions are systematically related to lower income inequalities
	while the reverse is true
	
	for majoritarian political institutions. We also make a crucial distinction
	between ¡¥collective¡¦
	
	and ¡¥competitive¡¦ veto points. Our multiple regression results provide
	strong evidence that
	
	collective veto points depress income inequalities while competitive
	veto points tend to widen
	
	the inequality of incomes. Thus, some institutional veto points have
	constraining effects on
	
	policy while others have ¡¥enabling¡¦ effects.},

	antagonisms.We show that the current prevalence of internal war is
	mainly the result of a steady
	
	accumulation of protracted conflicts since the 1950s and 1960s rather
	than a sudden change associated
	
	with a new, post-ColdWar international system.We also find that after
	controlling for per capita income,
	
	more ethnically or religiously diverse countries have been no more
	likely to experience significant civil
	
	violence in this period. We argue for understanding civil war in this
	period in terms of insurgency or
	
	rural guerrilla warfare, a particular form of military practice that
	can be harnessed to diverse political
	
	agendas. The factors that explain which countries have been at risk
	for civil war are not their ethnic or
	
	religious characteristics but rather the conditions that favor insurgency.
	These include poverty¡Xwhich
	
	marks financially and bureaucratically weak states and also favors
	rebel recruitment¡Xpolitical instability,

  abstract = {Using insights from social choice theory, particularly Black¡¦s concept
	of single-
	
	peaked preferences and Downs¡¦s median-voter model, the authors previously
	
	investigated the theoretical impact of the alternative vote system
	(AV) on
	
	the success of moderate parties in an ethnically bipolar society.
	Focusing on
	
	the simplest case, that with one moderate and one extremist ethnic
	party associated
	
	with each of the two ethnic groups, they found that forAVto necessarily
	
	yield outcomes that favor moderate parties there must be majority
	support for
	
	moderation and voter preferences that are single peaked with respect
	to the ethnic-
	
	conflict-defined dimension. Here, the authors test these assumptions
	with
	
	data from the 1999 and 2001 elections in Fiji, an ethnically bipolar
	society.
	
	They showthat Fiji¡¦s objective of ameliorating ethnic divisions by
	the adoption
	
	of AV was not successful. In elections in 1999 and 2001, moderate
	parties
	
	would have fared better under a proportional representation system.},

	competition. A careful reading of Downs offers a much more sophisticated
	and
	
	nuanced portrait of the factors affecting party differentiation than
	the simplistic notion
	
	that, in plurality elections, we ought to expect party convergence
	to the views of the
	
	median voter. Later scholars have built on Downsian ideas to see what
	happens vis-`avis
	
	party differentiation when we modify key assumptions found in the
	basic Downsian
	
	spatial model. Recent work allows us to turn what is taken to be the
	Downsian view on
	
	its head: Although there are pressures in two-party competition for
	the two parties to
	
	converge, in general we should expect nonconvergence. Moreover, contra
	the negative
	
	portrait offered by Green & Shapiro (1994) of the limited or nonexistent
	value of
	
	research on party competition models in the Downsian tradition, we
	argue that, when
	
	viewed as a whole, neo-Downsian models¡Xespecially those of the past
	decade¡Xdo
	
	allow us to reconcile theory and data in terms of a multi-componented
	theory of party
	
	competition with testable implications for comparative statics.},

	based on whether the intent of the policy is to share or divide power
	among rivals along its political, territorial, military,
	
	or economic dimension. Employing the statistical methodology of survival
	analysis to examine the 38 civil wars resolved
	
	via the process of negotiations between 1945 and 1998, we find that
	the more dimensions of power sharing among former
	
	combatants specified in a peace agreement the higher is the likelihood
	that peacewill endure.We suggest that this relationship
	
	obtains because of the unique capacity of power-sharing institutions
	to foster a sense of security among former enemies and
	
	encourage conditions conducive to a self-enforcing peace.},

  abstract = {Appellate courts make policy, not only by hearing cases themselves,
	but by establishing legal rules
	
	for the disposition of future cases. The problem is that such courts
	are generally multimember, or
	
	collegial, courts. If different judges prefer different rules, can
	a collegial court establishmeaningful
	
	legal rules? Can preferences that take the form of legal rules be
	aggregated? I use a ¡§case-space¡¨ model
	
	to show that there will exist a collegial rule that captures majoritarian
	preferences, and to show that there
	
	will exist a median rule even if there is no single median judge.
	I show how collegial rules can differ from
	
	the rules of individual judges and how judicial institutions (such
	as appellate review and the power to
	
	write separate opinions) affect the stability and enforceability of
	legal rules. These results are discussed
	
	in light of fundamental debates between legal and political perspectives
	on judicial behavior},

  journal = {European Journal of Political Economy},
  year = {2000},
  volume = {16},
  pages = {367--410},
  number = {3},
  abstract = {The median-voter hypothesis has been central to an extensive literature
	on consequences
	
	of income redistribution. For example, it has been proposed that greater
	inequality is
	
	associated with lower growth, because of the greater redistribution
	that is sought by the
	
	median voter when income distribution is less equal. There have however
	been no proper
	
	tests of the median-voter hypothesis concerning redistribution, because
	of previous absence
	
	of data on factor-income distributionthat is, incomes before taxes
	and transfers.across
	
	households, and thus on the gains by poorer households from redistribution.
	The study
	
	reported in this paper is based on the required data, with 79 observations
	drawn from
	
	household budget surveys from 24 democracies. The results strongly
	support the conclusion
	
	that countries with greater inequality of factor income redistribute
	more to the poor. This is
	
	so even when we control for the share of the elderly in the population
	and for pension
	
	transfers. The evidence that the median-voter hypothesis adequately
	describes the collective-
	
	choice mechanism is however considerably weaker. Although middle-income
	groups
	
	gain moreror lose less through redistribution in countries where initialfactor.income
	
	distribution is more unequal, this regularity is all but lost when,
	by excluding pensions, we look only at explicit redistributive social
	transfers from which middle classes contemporaneously
	
	gain little. This leaves us searching for an alternative explanation:
	do middle-classes
	
	gain from transfers in the long run even if not contemporaneously?;
	or is the median-voter
	
	hypothesis, based on direct democracy, a proper representation of
	the mechanisms of
	
	collective decision making in representative democracy? q2000 Elsevier

	nationalization, the electoral system explains much of the variance

	the types of shortcuts voters employ. When lists are closed, legislators'
	PVEA are of decreasing usefulness to voters as magnitude (and hence
	the number of candidates on a list) increases. When lists are open,
	legislators' PVEA are increasingly useful to voters as magnitude
	increases, because the number of candidates from which voters must
	choose whom to give a preference vote increases. As predicted by
	the theory, the probability that a legislator will exhibit PVEA-
	operationalized as local birthplace or lower-level electoral experience-declines
	with magnitude when lists are closed, but rises with magnitude when

  abstract = {Institutions shape social outcomes, yet institutions themselves are
	products of political choices. When
	
	institutional choices are determined by the same political and social
	processes that they shape, institutions are
	
	endogenously selected. Here I address the question of whether this
	endogenous institutional selection necessarily
	
	implies endogenous institutional effects. If it does, the use of institutional
	parameters as independent variables
	
	explaining policy outcomes and properties of the resulting political
	regimes, widespread in the literature on
	
	comparative political institutions, is hard to justify. I argue, however,
	that strategic choice of the rules of the game
	
	implies designers¡¦ ability to obtain their preferred institutional
	effects only under conditions of complete
	
	information. Under incomplete information, ex-post institutional effects
	do not need to be endogenous, since at
	
	the time of designing the rules the designers were not in position
	to control the selection of these effects. The
	
	reason why the choice of the rules does not imply the choice of their
	effects lies in the intervening and interactive
	
	(rather than additive) role played by the environmental parameters,
	including players¡¦ own characteristics, that are
	
	not revealed at the time of the institutional choice. Additionally
	to the model which illustrates the logic of the
	
	argument and the workings of intervening structural effects, I find
	supporting evidence in the processes of design
	
	of election laws in post-communist Europe, where stages of design
	and implementation followed each other in a
	
	very quick succession yet},

	has been hindered by the limitations of existing inequality data

	from these sources only at the cost of significantly reduced comparability
	across observations. The goal of the Standardized World Income Inequality
	Database (SWIID) is to overcome these limitations. A custom missing-data
	algorithm was used to standardize the U.N. University's World Income
	Inequality Database; data collected by the Luxembourg Income Study
	served as the standard. The SWIID provides comparable Gini indices
	of gross and net income inequality for 153 countries for as many
	years as possible from 1960 to the present, along with estimates
	of uncertainty in these statistics. By maximizing comparability for
	the largest possible sample of countries and years, the SWIID is
	better suited to broad cross-national research on income inequality

	This study examines this question using data from multiple cross-national
	surveys of the advanced industrial democracies.
	
	It tests the theory that greater inequality increases the relative
	power of the wealthy to shape politics in their own favor
	
	against rival arguments that focus on the effects of inequality on
	citizens¡¦ objective interests or the resources they have
	
	available for political engagement. The analysis demonstrates that
	higher levels of income inequality powerfully depress
	
	political interest, the frequency of political discussion, and participation
	in elections among all but the most affluent citizens,
	
	providing compelling evidence that greater economic inequality yields
	greater political inequality.},

  abstract = {This article tests expectations generated by the veto players theory
	with respect
	
	to the over time composition of budgets in a multidimensional policy
	space. The theory predicts
	
	that countries with many veto players (i.e., coalition governments,
	bicameral political
	
	systems, presidents with veto) will have difficulty altering the budget
	structures. In addition,
	
	countries that tend to make significant shifts in government composition
	will have commensurate
	
	modifications of the budget. Data collected from 19 advanced industrialized
	
	countries from 1973 to 1995 confirm these expectations, even when
	one introduces socioeconomic
	
	controls for budget adjustments like unemployment variations, size
	of retired
	
	population and types of government (minimum winning coalitions, minority
	or oversized
	
	governments). The methodological innovation of the article is the
	use of empirical indicators
	
	to operationalize the multidimensional policy spaces underlying the
	structure of
	
	budgets. The results are consistent with other analyses of macroeconomic
	outcomes like
	
	inflation, budget deficits and taxation that are changed at a slower
	pace by multiparty
	
	governments.},

	and then assesses their effect on economic growth and
	
	investment. In authoritarian regimes more dependent on domestic investment
	than natural resource revenue, the dictator
	
	creates a binding legislature as a credible constraint on the regime¡¦s
	confiscatory behavior. In regimes dependent on natural
	
	resource revenue, the nonbinding legislature serves as a mechanism
	for the dictator to bribe and split the opposition when
	
	he faces credible challenges to the regime. Using data from 121 authoritarian
	regimes from 1950 to 2002, the results indicate
	
	that binding legislatures have a positive impact on economic growth
	and domestic investment, while nonbinding legislatures
	
	have a negative impact on economic growth.},
